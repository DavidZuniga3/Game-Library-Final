# Game-Library-Final
Final project submission for CSC321 Web Application Development. The game library project is meant to resemble Letterboxd.
This project was made using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. The differences in this version of the project is that instead of using a JSON file to store the information of the video games, a database is used. In this database the user's information is stored, such as their email, password, and unique id. The game data is also stored in the database, such as title, year released, description, unique id, etc. There is also a table in the database for reviews, so information for the reviews would include the user id and game id as foreign keys, the review text, and the unique review id.
Databases were implemented in this project using MySQL and PHPMYADMIN. XAMPP was used in this project to host the website. The database is included in the db folder in the main project folder, if using PHPMYADMIN, you can import the sql file into it.
